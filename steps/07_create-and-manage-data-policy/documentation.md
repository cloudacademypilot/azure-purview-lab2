# Create and Manage Data policy

A new feature of Purview is Policies, which enables you to secure your data estate from within the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal.

Data access policies can be enforced through Purview on data systems that have been registered in Purview for scanning and data use management. 
This feature allows Data stewards and owners to grant read, write access to various data stores from within Purview by creating a data access policy through the Policy Management app in the governance portal, enabling a single dashboard view of all access granted to all systems.

A **policy** is a named collection of policy statements. When a policy is published to one or more data systems under Purview’s governance, it's then enforced by the system. 
A policy definition includes a policy name, description, and a list of one or more policy statements.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription.
* A Microsoft Purview account is already created and scanning of all assets is completed.
* User should have permissions to enable the Data Use Management (DUM) toggle for a data source, resource group, or subscription.
* User should have *Policy Author*, *Collection Admin* and *Data Source Admin* permissions in the Role Assignments.

## Objectives
